# Recipe Semantics
## Final Project for CS 553 Natural Language Processing

This project will involve attempting to gather information about ingredient equivalencies from recipes, and then do something like suggest ingredient substitutions.


`scraper.py` is the web scraper used to grab recipes from BigOven. Register for an account and define string `BIGOVEN_API_KEY` in `secrets.py`.

The code uses the `NLTK` python library for just about everything. It requires a local install of the [Stanford Parser](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml) too.
